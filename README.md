# Financial Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of financial engineering projects implemented in Python. These projects demonstrate various aspects of quantitative finance, including technical analysis, portfolio optimization, asset pricing, and option valuation.

## Projects

### 1. Technical Analysis and Trading Strategy Evaluation

- Implemented technical indicators: MACD, RSI, Stochastic Oscillator
- Developed and backtested trading strategies
- Visualized stock price trends and indicator signals
- Optimized strategy parameters for improved performance

### 2. Portfolio Optimization (Markowitz Model)

- Applied Modern Portfolio Theory to construct efficient portfolios
- Generated and visualized the efficient frontier
- Compared portfolios with and without short-selling constraints
- Analyzed sensitivity of portfolio weights to risk tolerance

### 3. Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)

- Estimated stock betas using historical data
- Calculated expected returns using CAPM
- Plotted the Security Market Line (SML)
- Analyzed stock valuation relative to CAPM predictions

### 4. Option Pricing Models

- Implemented Binomial and Black-Scholes option pricing models
- Analyzed option price sensitivity to various parameters
- Calculated option Greeks, including Delta
- Developed an implied volatility solver

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: yfinance, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to each project folder and run the respective Python scripts

## Future Work

- Implement more advanced trading strategies
- Explore machine learning applications in finance
- Extend option pricing to exotic options
